# DARK-THEME-GLPI
My very very dark glpi's theme :D 

# I'm stylezing all the css of the glpi's default theme, after finishing it, i will create a button that possibles the user
to change between the 2 themes.

You can try to make one theme all by yourself on home > entities > select your entity > UI customization
